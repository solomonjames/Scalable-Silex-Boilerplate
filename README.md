# Scalable Silex Boilerplate App

Out of the box, Silex is very powerful, but it doesn't leave you with much in the way of setting up a scalable architecture.  

This is a boilerplate Silex app that does that using controllers, routes, models, and config files - the way you would expect to see it in a framework like Symfony.
